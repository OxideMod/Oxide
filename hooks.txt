Hooks currently in Oxide 2 for Rust:

== OnInitLogging() ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/Bootstrap.StartupShared
	- No return behaviour
	- Used internally by Oxide to start Unity logging

== OnTick() ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ServerMgr.DoTick
	- No return behaviour
	- Called every tick (defined by the tickrate of the server?)

== ModifyTags(string oldtags) ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ServerMgr.UpdateServerInformation
	- Returning a string overrides the tags with new ones
	- Used by RustCore and abstracted into BuildServerTags

== BuildServerTags(IList<string> tags) ==
	- Called from RustCore.ModifyTags
	- No return behaviour
	- Add tags to the list, they will be concat'd at the end
    
== OnServerInitialized() ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ServerMgr
	- No return behaviour
	- Is called after the server startup has been completed and is awaiting connections

== OnRunCommand(Facepunch/ConsoleSystem.Arg arg) ==
	- Called from Facepunch/ConsoleSystem.Run, Facepunch/ConsoleSystem.RunUnrestricted and Facepunch/ConsoleSystem.ClientRun
	- Return true to override Rust's command handling system
	- Useful for intercepting commands before they get to their intended target (like chat.say)
	- Used by RustCore to implement chat commands

== OnUserApprove(Facepunch/Network.Connection connection) ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ConnectionAuth.OnNewConnection
	- Returning a non-null value overrides default behaviour, plugin should call Reject if it does this
	- Used by RustCore and abstracted into CanClientLogin

== CanClientLogin(Facepunch/Network.Connection connection) ==
	- Called from RustCore.OnUserApprove
	- Returning true will allow the connection, returning nothing will by default allow the connection, returning anything else will reject it with an error message
	- Returning a string will use the string as the error message

== OnFindSpawnPoint() ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ServerMgr
	- Return a Assembly-CSharp/BasePlayer.SpawnPoint object to use that spawnpoint
	- Useful for controlling player spawnpoints (like making all spawns occur in a set area)

== OnPlayerConnected(Facepunch/Network.Message packet) ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ServerMgr
	- No return behaviour
	- Is called before the player object is created, but after the player has been approved to join the game
	- Can get the connection from packet.connection

== OnPlayerSpawn(Assembly-CSharp/BasePlayer player, Facepunch/Network.Connection connection) ==
	- Called when the player spawns (specifically when they click the "Respawn" button)
	- No return behaviour
	- ONLY called when the player is transitioning from dead to not-dead, so not when they're waking up
	- This means it's possible for a player to connect and disconnect from a server without OnPlayerSpawn ever triggering for them

== OnRunPlayerMetabolism(Assembly-CSharp/PlayerMetabolism metabolism) ==
	- Called before a metabolism update occurs for the specified player
	- Returning true cancels the update
	- Metabolism update consists of managing the player's temperature, health etc
	- You can use this to turn off or change certain aspects of the metabolism, either by editing values before returning, or taking complete control of the method
	- Access the player object using metabolism:GetComponent("BasePlayer")

== OnPlayerDisconnected(Assembly-CSharp/BasePlayer player) ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ServerMgr
	- No return behaviour
	- Is called before the player object is created, but after the player has been approved to join the game

== OnPlayerAttack(Assembly-CSharp/BasePlayer attacker, Assembly-CSharp/HitInfo hitinfo) ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/BasePlayer
	- Returning true cancels the attack
	- Useful for modifying an attack before it goes out
	- hitinfo.HitEntity should be the entity that this attack would hit

== OnItemCraft(Assembly-CSharp/ItemCraftTask item)
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ItemCrafter
	- Return a Assembly-CSharp/ItemCraftTask object to modify behaviour
	- Is called right after an item has started crafting

	- Is called right after an item has been deployed

== OnItemAddedToContainer(Assembly-CSharp/ItemContainer container, Assembly-CSharp/Item item) ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ItemContainer
	- No return behaviour
	- Is called right after an item was added to a container
	- An entire stack has to be created, not just adding more wood to a wood stack for example

== OnItemRemovedFromContainer(Assembly-CSharp/ItemContainer container, Assembly-CSharp/Item item) ==
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/ItemContainer
	- No return behaviour
	- Is called right after an item was removed from a container
	- The entire stack has to be removed for this to be called, not just a little bit

== OnGather(Assembly-CSharp/ResourceDispenser dispenser, Assembly-CSharp/BaseEntity entity, Assembly-CSharp/Item item)
	- Assembly-CSharp/ResourceDispenser
	- No return behaviour
	- Is called before the player is given items from a resource

== CanOpenDoor(Assembly-CSharp/BasePlayer player, Assembly-CSharp/BaseLock door)
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/BaseLock
	- Returning true will allow door usage, nothing will by default will allow door usage, returning anything else will reject door usage

== CanOpenDoor(Assembly-CSharp/BasePlayer player, Assembly-CSharp/CodeLock code)
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/CodeLock
	- Returning true will allow door code usage, nothing will by default will allow door code usage, returning anything else will reject door code usage

== CanOpenDoor(Assembly-CSharp/BasePlayer player, Assembly-CSharp/KeyLock key)

== OnEntityAttacked(UnityEngine/MonoBehaviour entity, Assembly-CSharp/HitInfo hitinfo) ==
	- Called from multiple places, each entity's attack handler basically
	- Returning non-null value overrides default server behaviour (useful for godmode etc)
	- Alternatively, modify the hitinfo object to change the damage
	- It should be ok to set the damage to 0, but if you don't return non-null, the player's client will receive a damage indicator (if entity is a BasePlayer)
	- hitinfo has all kinds of useful things in it, such as hitinfo.Weapon, hitinfo.damageAmount or hitinfo.damageType
	- Currently implemented for: BasePlayer, BaseAnimal

== OnEntityDeath(UnityEngine/MonoBehaviour entity, Assembly-CSharp/HitInfo hitinfo) ==
	- Called from multiple places, each entity's death handler basically
	- No return behaviour
	- hitinfo might be null, check it before use

== OnPlayerChat(Assembly-CSharp/chat.say arg)
	- Called from Assembly-CSharp/chat.say
	- Returning a non-null value overrides default behaviour of chat, not commands

Plugin specific hooks:

== Init() ==
	- Called when the plugin is being loaded

	- Other plugins WILL have been executed though, so globals exposed by them will be present

== LoadDefaultConfig() ==
	- Called when the config for the plugin should be initialised
	- Only called if the config file does not already exist

== Unload() ==
	- Called when the plugin is being unloaded
